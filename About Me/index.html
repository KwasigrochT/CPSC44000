                <p>
                    Hello I am Theodore Kwasigroch, I am a junior/senior here at Lewis and I am a major in Computer Science. I am a student who is returning to college after I
                    had dropped out of college during the Covid 19 Pandemic. I am returning into the field of computer science as while I have a comfortable job right now I am 
                    looking to forward my career and have a better job as I intend to marry my girlfriend of 8 years and have a house and family. I am currently just a Computer
                    Science major with no declared minor although I am thinking of getting a certification in IT by studying independently, as I think it would look quite nice
                    on a resume. 
                </p>
